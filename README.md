## üèÉ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Run

First of all, you should create file `.env`. 
> ***All operation methods require this step.***

```env
http_proxy=http://host:port
rapid_api_key=xxxxxxxxxx
EMAIL_TYPE=temp-email44
DEBUG=0
POOL_SIZE=0
PHIND_POOL_SIZE=0
```

- `http_proxy`: config your proxy if you can not access target website directly; If you dont need proxy, delete this line;
- `forefront` use env(this site has been removed): 
  - `rapid_api_key`: you should config this if you use forefront api, this apikey is used for receive register email, get api key here
  - `EMAIL_TYPE`: temp email type includes `temp-email` `temp-email44` `tempmail-lol`
      - [temp-email](https://rapidapi.com/Privatix/api/temp-mail): soft limit 100req/days, if over use money, need bind credit card! Very Stable!
      - [temp-email44](https://rapidapi.com/calvinloveland335703-0p6BxLYIH8f/api/temp-mail44): hard limit 100req/days! Stable!
      - [tempmail-lol](): nothing need, limit 25request/5min. Not Stable.
  - `DEBUG`: Valid when use `forefront` You can set =1 when you run local. show reverse process
  - `POOL_SIZE`: `forefront` concurrency size. Keep set=1 until you run it successfully!!! You can engage in {POOL_SIZE} conversations concurrently. More pool size, More conversation can be done simultaneously, But use more RAM
- `phind` use env:
  - `PHIND_POOL_SIZE`: `phind` concurrency size.You can engage in {POOL_SIZE} conversations concurrently. More pool size, More conversation can be done simultaneously, But use more RAM

### Run local üñ•Ô∏è 

```shell
# install module
yarn
# start server
yarn start
```

### Run with docker(Suggest!) üê≥ 

```
docker run -p 3000:3000 --env-file .env xiangsx/gpt4free-ts:latest
```

### Deploy with docker-compose üé≠ 

first, you should create file .env; Follow step "Run with docker

deploy

```
docker-compose up --build -d
```
